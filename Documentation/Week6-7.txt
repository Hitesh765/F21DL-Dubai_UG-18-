Summary:
D1: Clustering
    1. Scaled venue metrics, team performance, and toss statistics to prepare data for clustering.
    2. Applied K-Means with different cluster sizes, assessing quality through silhouette scores and  visualizing results using scatter plots.
    3. Adjusted features like result margins and toss-win ratios to identify meaningful patterns in the data.

D2: Clustering
    1. Experimented with varying the number of clusters to assess their impact on accuracy and separability.
    2. Refined clustering experiments, tuning hyperparameters for both K-Means (e.g., number of clusters) and Hierarchical Clustering (e.g., linkage criteria).
    3. Generated initial visualizations using PCA to project high-dimensional data into 2D, focusing on  identifying overlaps and separations between classes.

Challenges: 
Determining the optimal number of clusters was challenging due to diverse data characteristics. Interpreting PCA results required deep analysis to make meaningful inferences about the data structure.

Next Steps: 
Focus on the systematic implementation of k-NN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Naive Bayes models using the preprocessed data. This will establish a baseline for performance and identify initial strengths and weaknesses in handling the dataset.
