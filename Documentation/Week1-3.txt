Week Work Distribution for Group 18 - DMML
Our group collaboratively worked on two datasets simultaneously: a numerical dataset (D1: IPL Dataset) and an image dataset (D2: Sports Ball Image Dataset). Weekly meetups were conducted to track progress, discuss challenges, and plan upcoming tasks. Each session ensured effective follow-ups and aligned the groupâ€™s efforts toward achieving the project goals for both datasets.
D1 - (IPL Dataset)
D2 - (Sports Ball Image Dataset)

2.Work and Task Distribution

Challenges: 
The primary challenge was selecting datasets that aligned well with our project goals and offered sufficient depth for analysis. Ensuring all team members were on board with the project scope and had a clear understanding of their responsibilities was crucial.

Next Steps: 
Begin a detailed analysis of the datasets, focusing on understanding the data's characteristics, identifying missing data, and starting preprocessing tasks. Setup regular team meetings for progress updates and troubleshooting.
