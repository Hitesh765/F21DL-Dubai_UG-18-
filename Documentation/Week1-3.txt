Week Work Distribution for Group 18 - DMML
Our group collaboratively worked on two datasets simultaneously: a numerical dataset (D1: IPL Dataset) and an image dataset (D2: Sports Ball Image Dataset). Weekly meetups were conducted to track progress, discuss challenges, and plan upcoming tasks. Each session ensured effective follow-ups and aligned the groupâ€™s efforts toward achieving the project goals for both datasets.
