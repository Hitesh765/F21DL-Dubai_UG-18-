# Kaggle Dataset Downloader

This project provides a Python script to download Kaggle datasets using the Kaggle API. It requires a valid Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) and the `kaggle` Python package to work.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**:
   - Ensure Python 3.6 or later is installed. You can check by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **Kaggle API Key**:
   - Download your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) from your [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account). Save it in a known location.

3. **Install Kaggle Package**:
   - Open a terminal and install the Kaggle CLI using:
     ```bash
     pip install kaggle
     ```

## Files Needed

1. **Python Script**:
   - Save the Python script to your desired location.
2. **Kaggle API Key**:
   - Ensure the `kaggle.json` file is downloaded and accessible.

## Example Command to run 

If your `IPL Dataset.py` script and `kaggle.json` file are saved on your Desktop, the command will look like this:
```bash
python "C:\Users\hp\Desktop\IPL Dataset.py" "C:\Users\hp\Desktop\kaggle.json"
```

If the files are saved elsewhere, make sure to update the paths accordingly.
