# Image Classification and IPL Winner Prediction
This repository contains resources and documentation for our project, which focuses on two main tasks:

Classifying images of balls into predefined categories.
Predicting the winner of IPL matches based on match data.

**Project Overview**
We aim to explore machine learning and data analysis techniques to solve two distinct problems:

Image Classification: Using a ball dataset, we preprocess images and build models to classify different types of sportsballs.
IPL Winner Prediction: Leveraging the IPL dataset, we analyze past match data and predict match winners.
