## **Project Description**

---

### *R2: Data Preprocessing, Data Augmentation, and EDA*
In R2, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the structure and quality of the datasets. For the IPL dataset, visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps highlighted key patterns like the impact of toss decisions and venues on match outcomes. For the image dataset, preprocessing involved resizing images to 123px Ã— 100px, cropping a 20px banner, and balancing class distributions to a maximum of 400 images per class. Data augmentation, including horizontal flipping, enriched underrepresented classes. Dummy bounding boxes were merged with metadata. Both EDA and augmentation ensured data readiness for subsequent modeling tasks.

### *R3: Clustering*
Clustering was used as an unsupervised technique to explore patterns in both datasets. In the IPL dataset, k-means clustering segmented venues, teams, and toss dynamics, identifying key groupings like high-scoring venues and dominant teams. For the image dataset, high-dimensional RGB data was analyzed using feature reduction, followed by clustering with methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering. These methods revealed overlaps and separability among classes, providing insights into feature quality. Performance metrics like inertia and clustering accuracy informed preprocessing adjustments and feature selection strategies. This analysis uncovered hidden patterns and relationships in the data, guiding further tasks.

---

### *R4: Fundamental Algorithms*
This stage focused on implementing baseline models to compare performance across datasets. For the IPL dataset, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN models were used to predict match outcomes based on features like venue, toss, and team performance. For the image dataset, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests were applied to classify images. Both datasets underwent robust evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations like confusion matrices and ROC curves analyzed prediction quality. These models served as benchmarks for subsequent deep learning approaches, providing insights into data separability and model robustness.

---

### *R5: Advanced Modeling*
Advanced modeling introduced deep learning techniques for both datasets. For the IPL dataset, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers was implemented, leveraging preprocessed features to enhance prediction accuracy. For the image dataset, both MLPs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were developed. CNNs utilized spatial hierarchies with convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification. Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy and loss, demonstrating the power of neural networks in handling complex patterns. This stage highlighted the superiority of deep learning over traditional models for both tabular and image datasets.
