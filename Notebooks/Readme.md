## Portfolios

### 1. **IPL Portfolio**: *Numerical Dataset*
   - **Description**: 
     This portfolio focuses on the IPL dataset, a numerical dataset containing records of IPL matches from 2008 to 2020. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques applied to a structured numerical dataset.
   - **Dataset**: 
     The dataset used is the IPL Complete Dataset (2008-2020), which includes detailed information about matches, teams, scores, and other numerical features.
   - **Techniques Covered**:
     - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
     - Feature Engineering and Selection.
     - Model Training and Evaluation

### 2. **SportsBall Portfolio**: *Image Dataset*
   - **Description**: 
     This portfolio uses the Sports Ball Dataset, which contains images of various sports balls (e.g., cricket balls, basketballs, etc.). It demonstrates how to work with image data using computer vision and deep learning techniques.
   - **Dataset**: 
     The dataset includes images of different types of sports balls, categorized into classes.
   - **Techniques Covered**:
     - Image Preprocessing and Augmentation.
     - Feature Extraction 
     - Model Training and Evaluation
